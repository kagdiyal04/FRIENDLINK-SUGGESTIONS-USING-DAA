# FRIENDLINK-SUGGESTIONS-USING-DAA
FriendLink is a smart friend suggestion system using Flask, SQLite, and HTML/CSS. It suggests friends via BFS (mutual connections) and Jaccard Similarity (age, location, interests). Users can add/delete friends, upload photos, and ignore suggestions. I developed the backend, logic, and UI integration.
